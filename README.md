# Room of Oneself

An adventure game focus on the "self" topic featuring vertical layering music and abstract narrative.


### Development Status:

Currently, this project is under early stage development. We're experimenting the core gameplay features using rapid prototyping.

**Code**: 

- Designed and implemented features like: audio system for both 2d and 3d sounds, UI widget with simple tween, input handler state machine, etc. for the full game.
- Currently making the first rapid prototype "The River" which is inspired by "the river reflected whatever it chose of" using throwaway code. Have finished the scene transition demo, now working on the items unlock, pickup and place features.

**Music**: 

- Decided to use vertical layering techniques for both music and ambience sound effect.
- Currently composing the music and its layers. Have finished some fragment parts, now working on the rest parts.

**Level**:

- Decided there would be 3 to 5 pre-set levels and a blank level for customizing in total. Designed 2 rough levels for the first prototype.
- Currently listing the levels, the transition props, and the interactable items.

**Narrative**:

- Decided the narrative should be abstract and focus on female and self topic.
- Currently working on the outline of the story.
